Sun Race 2179
=============

*As I listened, I could see a solar-sail space ship, passing close to the sun. 
The crew of the yacht are standing quietly. Scarcely moving. Waiting...*

I am a *future realism* [writer](https://gavinchait.com) and my next novel is 
about a yachting disaster that took place during the biannual Sun Race of 2179, 
almost exactly 200 years after the [Fastnet tragedy of 1979](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fastnet-Force-10-Deadliest-History-ebook/dp/B007HXKY86/).

The objective of the solar yacht race is to sail a purely mechanical space-yacht 
from Mercury around the Sun and then return to Mercury.

I do a great deal of research during each of my novels, most of which never makes 
it into the narrative except in very subtle ways. For example, I spent two weeks 
researching and calculating the mass and energy potential for [aluminium air 
batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium%E2%80%93air_battery) in my 
first novel, [Lament for the Fallen](https://lamentforthefallen.com).

I've decided to do things differently this time and show the sausage-making 
process.

In this series I will be working through the fundamental physics of the race 
with the objective of showing what would be required (very superficially) for 
such an event to take place, and the sorts of challenges that each ship's 
navigators will have to overcome.

All research will be presented in [Jupypter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and 
I'm happy to receive feedback and corrections. If you spot any errors please do
file an issue and I'll make the necessary fixes...
